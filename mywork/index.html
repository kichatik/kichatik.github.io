            <p>Prices and discounts were part of each insurer's assessment, but we know that cost is the main factor for
                many car insurance buyers. Since prices depend on personal factors, including your age, location,
                car, credit history and gender (in most cases), it is important to look for car insurance rates.</p>

                you need to find the cheapest tariff. But your shopping experience will also shed light on the company's customer service standards

                car insurance companies:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> 1. Visit the website of your State Commissioner for 
                <br>
                insurance to find complaints and other information about 
                <br>
                companies in your area.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Ask your agent or service representative 
                <br>
                Support any questions to make sure you 
                <br>
                you get all the necessary coverage and nothing extra.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Let's also consider smaller insurance companies. 
                <br>
                small companies in many countries offer rates 
                <br>
                much lower than that of major competitors.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. If you had tickets, DUI, or other violations,
                <br>
                be sure to make purchases three or five years after 
                <br>
                an incident where surcharges may decrease significantly.</p>
