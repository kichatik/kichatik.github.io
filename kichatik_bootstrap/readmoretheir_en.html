                        <h3>Miyagi's creative biography started in the first years of medical university. He recorded his debut tracks in 2011, and 4 years later 
                            Miyagi presented the first album to music lovers. It was recorded in St. Petersburg, where the performer moved. In the city on the Neva Azamat 
                            he completely gave himself up to creativity and opened his own music studio. It was here that the future colleague and partner in the duet Soslan Burnatsev looked in 
                            (Endgame). He turned out to be not only a rap fan and performer, but also a fellow countryman of Kudzaev. Burnatsev is 5 years younger than Kudzaev, 
                            I became interested in rap at the age of 15 with the "light hand" of my uncle. After graduating from school, Endgame received a degree in technology, but already at the institute 
                            he knew that his profession would be different – related to music and his favorite direction. Before meeting Miyagi , Soslan Burnatsev released 
                            a solo album called "Scum", a year later a second one appeared – "Tyutelka to Tyutelka".
                            Before meeting with the Endgame, Miyagi also managed to record several compositions that distinguished a young artist in the Russian rap industry. 
                            The songs "House", "Bonnie", "Sky" and "I'm head over heels in love with You".
                            The fateful meeting of Ossetian musicians in the Northern capital gave birth to a unique duo Miyagi & Endgame, in which the symbiosis of rap 
                            and reggae gave bright, memorable hits to fans. The musicians were inspired by the work of the famous Bob Marley and Travis Scott,
                            but the Vladikavkazians did not imitate the cult musicians: they have found their own style and niche.
                            Miyagi and her partner posted their first songs and videos on social networks and YouTube. The duo instantly had an army 
                            fans. The debut clips of Miyagi and the Endgame are quite "democratic": the guys did not have money for high-budget shooting. 
                            The musicians "took" fans with the quality of compositions, impeccable performance and dissimilarity from other colleagues in the direction. 
                            The duet tracks posted on the VKontakte page have gained thousands of likes. Rappers proved that without loud phits, recommendations 
                            stars and money in the Russian show business can break through to the top.
                            In 2016, Miyagi created 2 albums Hajime and Hajime 2 in a duet with a fellow countryman musician, which raised the musicians to 
                            the top of the charts. In 2016, a popular vote identified the duo Miyagi & Endgame as the "discovery of the year". In the same year 
                            The premiere of the new composition Miyagi & Endgame "Toastmaster" took place. Later, the musicians released a remix of the song.
                            Purposeful Ossetians, rapidly gaining popularity, did not suffer from the star disease: the guys worked hard 
                            working on new compositions, trying to keep the balance and not to leave all the energy on concerts and tours. Fans demand new hits, 
                            and it's not fair to deceive them by remaking one "shot" track. Compositions "Babylon", "Before the Melt", One Love Miyagi and the Endgame 
                            they became hits for downloading from the Internet.</h3>
