                            There was a creative atmosphere in Azamat's family, although his parents had no direct relation to art. 
                            Father and mother, Ossetians by nationality, are doctors. Kazbek Kudzaev is a respected surgeon at home,

                            — a popular Russian rapper, about whose creative biography we can safely say:
                            the musician achieved everything with his own talent and work. The performer became a real discovery for North Ossetia, 
                            and then for the whole country. After graduating from school, the musician went to study technology. 
                            However, fortunately for the fans, he did not work in this specialty, choosing a radically different path in life 
                            — the way to the stage.</p>
